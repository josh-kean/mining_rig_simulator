# Bitcoin Mining Rig Simulator
This is a simulator to help guide you to set up your bitcoin mining rig. The overall goal is to accuratley simulate your mining profitability based on your location, electricity costs, equipment costs, hash rate, and mining difficulty. Do not base your business decisions off of these numbers, this project is very much a work in progress.

## Development Stages

### Pre Alpha
- Create preprogrammed GPU's with built in specifications
- Allow user to specify number of GPU's, variety of GPU's, electricity cost, hashes / watt

### Alpha
- Allow user to create custom chips
- Allow user to combine custom chips with preprogrammed GPU's
- Provide currenty difficulty based on onchain data
- Display heat produced per chip

### Beta
- Allow user to specify all components of mining rig, including motherboard, processor, ram
- Show heat rise and simulate scaling back of performance
- Allow users to copy/compare different setups

### MVP
- Get chip specifications from a url
- Basic air conditioning cost calculations
- Identify cost saving and or performance enhancements
